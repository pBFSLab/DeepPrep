Running with Docker step-by-step
---------------------------------

DeepPrep provides a docker image as the recommended way to get started.

.. note::
    **Required Environment**
        + Graphics Driver VRAM: >= 24GB
        + Disk: >= 20G
        + RAM: >= 16GB
        + Swap space: >=16G
        + Ubuntu:  >= 20.04
        + NVIDIA Driver: >= 11.8

1. Install Docker if you don't have one (`Docker Installation Page`_).

.. _Docker Installation Page: https://www.docker.com/get-started/


2. Test Docker with the ``hello-world`` image:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    $ docker run -it --rm hello-world

The following message should appear:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
     1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
     2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
     3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
     4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.

    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
     $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

    Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

     https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

3. Please make sure GPUs are accessible by adding the flag ``--gpus all``:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    $ docker run -it --gpus all --rm hello-world

The same output as before is expected.

4. Pull the Docker image

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    $ docker pull deepprep:latest

5. Sample Docker command

.. code-block:: bash
    :linenos:

    $ docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
    -v <input_dir>:/BIDS_DATASET \
    -v <output_dir>:/DEEPPREP_RESULT_DIR \
    -v <freesurfer_license>:/usr/local/freesurfer/license.txt \
    -v <config_file>:/nextflow.docker.local.config \
    deepprep:latest \
    -with-report /DEEPPREP_RESULT_DIR/QC/report.html \
    -with-timeline /DEEPPREP_RESULT_DIR/QC/timeline.html \
    -resume \
    -c /nextflow.docker.local.config \
    --bids_dir /BIDS_DATASET \
    --bold_task_type rest

**Let's dig into the mandatory commands**
    + ``--gpus all`` assigns all the available GPUs on the local host to the container.
    + ``-v`` flag mounts your local directories to the directories inside the container. The input directories should be in *absolute path* to avoid any confusions.
    + The ``<input_dir>`` should be in `bids format`_.
    .. _bids format: https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html
    + ``<freesurfer_license>`` is the directory of a valid FreeSurfer License.
    + ``deepprep:latest`` is the docker image.

**Dig further (optional commands)**
    + ``-it`` starts the container in an interactive mode.
    + ``--rm`` the container will be removed when exit.
    + ``-resume`` allows the deepprep pipeline starts from the last exit point.
    + ``--bold_task_type`` is the task type of BOLD images (i.e. rest, motor).
    + ``--subjects`` is the subject id you want to process, otherwise all the subjects in the ``<input_dir>`` will be processed.
    + ``--subjects_dir`` is the output directory of *Recon* files, the default directory is ``<output_dir>/Recon``.
    + ``--anat_only True`` only the anatomical images will be processed, default is ``False``.
    + ``--bold_only True`` only the functional images will be processed, where *Recon* files are pre-requests. The default is ``False``.
    + ``--bold_sdc`` applies Susceptibility Distortion Correction (SDC) on BOLD images, default is ``True``.




..
    There are two container ways to install DeepPrep：
       * using Docker container technology.or
       * using Singularity container technology.

    The deepprep command-line adheres to the BIDS-Apps recommendations for the user interface.
    Therefore, the command-line has the following structure: ::
        $ deepprep <input_bids_path> <output_derivatives_path> <analysis_level> <named_options>

    The deepprep command-line options are documented in the **Usage Notes** section.

    Minimal system requirements
        * Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 or higher
        * RAM: at least 16 GB
        * Swap space: at least 16 GB
        * Hard disk: at least 20 GB
        * GPU VRAM: at least 24 GB
        * NVIDIA Driver: CUDA Toolkit 11.8 or higher

    After successfully downloading and installing the container (docker and singularity), load the image
    package into the Docker local warehouse::

        $ sudo docker load --input deepprep_v0.0.14ubuntu22.04.tar.gz

    load the image package into the Singularity local warehouse::

        $ Singularity 安装 DeepPrep
