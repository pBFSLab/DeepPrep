    caption: SynthMorph used anatomical MRI data to generate transformations from T1w-space to standard-template-space, and then applied the transformations to functional data in T1w-space.

    caption: TSNR from nipype was used to compute the temporal SNR maps.

  - bids: { datatype: figures, desc: carpet, suffix: bold }
    caption: The picture was ploted by the FMRISunmmary from the nipype and these values were calculated by the following methods.\n Global signals (GS) were calculated within the whole-brain, and the white-matter (GSWM) and the cerebro-spinal fluid (GSCSF) were calculated with their corresponding masks. The standardized DVARS was calculated by ComputeDVARS from the nipype. The framewise-displacement measures (FD) were calculated by FramewiseDisplacement from the nipype. The relative head motion (RHM) was calculated in this pipeline. \n A carpet plot shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask. Cortical gray matter (Ctx GM), subcortical gray matter (dGM), white matter and CSF (WM+CSF), and the rest of brain (The rest) were devided into four groups.
